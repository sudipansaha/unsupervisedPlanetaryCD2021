# Patch-level unsupervised planetary change detection

## Change detection (CD) is still a relatively new topic in the context of planetary exploration. Sheer variation of planetary data makes CD much more challenging than in the case of Earth observation (EO). This work is probably the 1st unsupervised effort towards change change detection in this context.
